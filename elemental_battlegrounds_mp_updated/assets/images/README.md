This directory contains image files used for the units in the game.  By default all
unit images are simple grey placeholders, but you can replace any of the files
with your own artwork.  The file names correspond to the unit names in
lowercase (e.g. `fire.png` for the Fire unit, `steam.png` for the Steam unit).

Custom units created via the card editor will also look for an image in this
directory using the custom unit name (converted to lowercase and spaces
replaced with hyphens) followed by `.png`.  If an image file with that name
doesn't exist, the game will fall back to displaying the unit's emoji instead.
