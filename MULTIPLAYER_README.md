## Game Flow

### 1. Connection Phase
- Player enters name and connects to server
- Server assigns unique player ID
- Connection status displayed with visual indicators

### 2. Matchmaking Phase

- **Room Settings**: Turn timers, ranked/unranked options

### 3. Preparation Phase
- Both players build their armies simultaneously
- Real-time updates show opponent's progress
- Turn timer counts down preparation time
- Players can see opponent's army size and gold

### 4. Battle Phase
- Armies are revealed simultaneously
- Passive abilities are calculated and applied
- Battle resolution with real opponent armies
- Winner determined by total power + passive effects

### 5. Post-Battle
- Results shared between players
- Rankings updated (if ranked match)
- Option to rematch or return to matchmaking
